# Twitter_Airline_Sentiment_Analysis
Nowadays, billions of people worldwide are already engaged in social media communities. It becomes a primary place for life and opinion sharing. Twitter, as one of the leading social media companies in the world, gives consumers direct access to the brands by adding a simple mention or @ to their tweets. Analyzing tens of thousands of tweets and collecting valuable customer feedback becomes essential to business owners. 

In the US airline industry, a few companies take up a high percentage of the market and can't afford to ignore the actions of others. Therefore, insight into customers' feedback on their business and competitors' business is essential. 

The project used machine learning models to identify the emotional tone the tweets carry and collected the most predictive keywords, which allow the airlines to improve offered services quickly and aid them in devising new schemes for the future.
